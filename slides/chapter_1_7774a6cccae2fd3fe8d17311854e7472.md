## Idea behind the Apriori algorithm

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "154971ef68"
```

`@part1`
**Remember**: Each transaction is seen as a set of items 

Purpose of the Apriori algorithm:
1. Determine frequent itemsets of a potentially large database of transactions
2. Extract some induced rules from the itemsets, known as _association rule learning_ over transactional database

Allows to discover interesting relationships between "variables" in large database.

| Trx ID | Trx                          |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 1      | {Bread, Butter, Ham, Cheese} |
| 2      | {Bread, Cheese}              |
| 3      | {Butter, Ham}                |
| 4      | {Bread, Ham, Cheese}         |

## Backbone of Apriori algorithm

```yaml

Idea/rationale

- Bottom-up approach
- Level-wise, breath-first algorithm which counts transactions

## Apriori function from the arules package

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "c1e7bf828c"
```

`@part1`
```
library(arules)
# Recall from previous lessons
Itemfrequency()
ItemfrequencyPlot()
image()
```


`@part2`
Input transactional dataset

```
apriori(data, parameter = list(support = 0.1, confidence = 0.6))
```

## Parameters and controls of the apriori

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0472819503"
```

`@part1`
- **Parameter**: the mining parameters change the characteristics of the mined itemsets or rules (e.g. minimum support)
- **Control**: influence the performance of the algorithm (e.g. ???)
