## Idea behind the Apriori algorithm

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "154971ef68"
```

`@part1`
**Remember**: Each transaction is seen as a set of items 

Purpose of the Apriori algorithm:
1. Determine frequent itemsets of a potentially large database of transactions
2. Extract some induced rules from the itemsets, known as _association rule learning_ over transactional database

Allows to discover interesting relationships between "variables" in large database.

| Trx ID | Trx                          |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 1      | {Bread, Butter, Ham, Cheese} |
| 2      | {Bread, Cheese}              |
| 3      | {Butter, Ham}                |
| 4      | {Bread, Ham, Cheese}         |
