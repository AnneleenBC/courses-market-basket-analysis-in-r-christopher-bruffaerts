## Apriori algorithm

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"

**Remember**: Each transaction is seen as a set of items 

Purpose of the Apriori algorithm:
1. Determine frequent itemsets of a potentially large database of transactions
2. Extract some induced rules from the itemsets, known as _association rule learning_ over transactional database

Allows to discover interesting relationships between "variables" in large database.
